# Bienes ðŸ§®ðŸ¤–

Spanish for Assets, Bienes is intended to store general Visual assets, experiments & elements created with p5.js.




# Structure

##### Experiment
- An experiment will have it's own repo.
- An experiment will have it's own unique folder.

##### Public
- A global assets folder found in the root directory.
- Has a `master.css` for quick-and-easy styling on new experiments
- Has a `bundle.js` that contains a generic set of javascript.
  - Possibly not needed for most usecases right now.
- Common visual assets many experiments could benefit from.

Bottom line? If more then one experiment will use the asset: put it in the public file. _Let's try not to change the public contents unnecessarly to avoid breaking experiments_

##### index.html
Something that will navigate us to each experiment.
