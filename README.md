# Bienes ðŸŽ¨

Spanish for Assets, Bienes is intended to store general Visual assets, experiments & elements created with p5.js.

## Getting started
To ease development times we'll use [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/command-line/) to serve the files locally.
### Installation
- Let's install [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/command-line/) with: `npm install -g browser-sync`.

### Finally:
- `browser-sync -f "*.js"` will start [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/command-line/), every time we edit a js file it'll automatically update. A browser window will automatically be opened for us as well.



# Structure

##### Experiment
- An experiment will have it's own repo.
- An experiment will have it's own unique folder.

##### Public
- A global assets folder found in the root directory.
- Has a `master.css` for quick-and-easy styling on new experiments
- Has a `bundle.js` that contains a generic set of javascript.
  - Possibly not needed for most usecases right now.
- Common visual assets many experiments could benefit from.

Bottom line? If more then one experiment will use the asset: put it in the public file. _Let's try not to change the public contents unnecessarly to avoid breaking experiments_

##### index.html
Something that will navigate us to each experiment.



# Example:
```
.
